# CommandCleanup
CommandCleanup started as a simple bot that would deleted messages that begin with certain symbols.
It has been almost a year since then and I'd like to think the bot has become so much more!

We've had countless feature requests such as automated discord link removal, delete messages with attachments only, delete messages of users that no longer exist and etc.. there hasn't been a request *(that helps with moderation)* so far that I haven't been able to add into this bot. 

***a full list of feature can be found at https://discordbots.org/bot/420013638468894731***

We're currently on more then 1900+ servers as of writing this and to everyone that has given this bot a chance, thanks!
I never would of thought a simple bot like this would actually be so popular..
