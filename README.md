# CommandCleanup
CommandCleanup started as a simple bot that would deleted messages that began with certain symbols.
The bot was originally created for my personal server, but I decided to upload it to discordbots.org and since then and I'd like to think the bot has become so much more thanks to the communities feedback and requests!

We've had countless features requested and added to the bot; such as automated discord link removal, delete messages with certain attachments types, delete messages of users that no longer exist and etc.. There are more features planned for the future as well such as a dashboard, timed events and automated moderation.

***a full list of current features can be found at https://discordbots.org/bot/420013638468894731***

We're currently on more then 10000+ servers as of writing this and to everyone that has given this bot a chance, thanks!
I never would of thought a simple bot like this would actually be so popular..
